# WeaponEffects

WeaponEffects is a simple but yet powerful plugin to customize game experience of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
It simply adds [Status effects](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Status_effect) (also known as Potion effects) to items.
Holding them in your hand thereby gives you the specified status effects.

This plugin works on Spigot/Paper 1.14.4. 

## Installation on Spigot

Simply run `mvn package` to build the plugin jar. A download link will be added soonâ„¢.
Drop the jar file and the [Item-NBT-API](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/item-entity-tile-nbt-api.7939/) in your
plugin folder and restart the server.

## Configuration

You can adjust the behaviour of the plugin by editing the `config.yml` file in the plugin's directory. 
The different settings are explained there.

Edit the `messages.yml` if you want to change the messages. Colors are supported.

**Please note**: If you want to edit messages like the command help, you'll need to edit files inside of the .jar file. 
Those messages are provided by the Annotation Command Framework.

This helps to keep the plugin compatible with different versions.

Internally, the plugin uses Aikar's 
[Annotation Command Framework](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/acf-beta-annotation-command-framework.234266/) to handle
commands in a smooth and intelligent way.
